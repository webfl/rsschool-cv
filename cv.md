## About
Everything related to frontend development and web design is interesting to me. I made websites on Wordpress, but at some point realized that websites builders are very restrictive for the developer and besides, the code is very heavy. So I began to study HTML & CSS, a little bit PHP. But this is not enough for quality web development.
